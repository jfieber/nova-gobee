## Version 0.0.1

This is our first "pre"-release. It supports a lot of functionality, although there is
quite a lot more to do. Syntax with Tree-sitter should work quite well for most things,
but the gopls LSP integration still could do with a lot more enhancement. (Nonetheless
this is likely more functional than some of the other extensions available for Nova.)
